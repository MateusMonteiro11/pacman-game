Pac-Man Clone 🎮

This project is a Pac-Man clone developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my Fullstack course final project at FEI University.
The goal of this project was to rebuild the classic Pac-Man game while implementing game logic, map generation, and basic artificial intelligence for enemy movement.

🚀 Features:

* Map Generation with Binary Manipulation;

* The game map was constructed using binary values to represent walls, paths, and special items;

* This approach allowed efficient control over game collisions and easy visualization of the maze structure;

* Sprite Definition and Animation;

* Pac-Man and ghosts are rendered using sprite logic;

* Smooth animations were implemented for movement, ensuring the game feels dynamic and engaging;

* Ghost AI with Decision-Making;

* Each ghost has a small AI system that allows it to “sense” Pac-Man within a certain range;

* Based on proximity, the AI decides whether to chase or reposition, simulating intelligent pursuit strategies;

* Pathfinding techniques were implemented to improve enemy behavior and increase game challenge;

🕹️ How to Play:

1. Visist the repository website: https://mateusmonteiro11.github.io/pacman-game/

2. Use the arrow keys or wasd to move Pac-Man around the maze;

3. Avoid the ghosts and eat all the pellets to win the game.

📂 Project Structure:

* index.html → Main menu;

* pacman.html → Main entry of the game;

* style.css → Game styling and layout;

* home.css → The menu style;

* game.js → Envolves the logic of the game;

* ghost.js → Envolves the logic of the ghosts;

* home.js → All interactions provided by the menu of the game;

* pacman.js → Pacman logic and resources;

* imagens/ → Sprites and additional resources.

🎓 About the Project:

This project was developed as a semester final project for my Fullstack course at FEI.
It was a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, algorithm design, and artificial intelligence applied to game development.
